# One approach for using an LSTM network to classify sequences of letters as grammatically correct or incorrect is to use the network to model the probability of the entire sequence given its grammaticality label. This can be done by feeding the LSTM network a sequence of one-hot vectors representing each letter in the input sequence, and using the final output of the LSTM as the input to a softmax classifier that predicts the grammaticality label.
